## ðŸ“£ What is Linux?

**Linux is an open source operating system (OS). The so-called operating system refers to the software that directly manages the system hardware and resources (such as CPU, memory and storage space). The operating system sits between applications and hardware and is responsible for establishing connections between all software and related physical resources.**
