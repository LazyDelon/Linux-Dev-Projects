## 📣 What is Linux?

**Linux is an open source operating system (OS). The so-called operating system refers to the software that directly manages the system hardware and resources (such as CPU, memory and storage space). The operating system sits between applications and hardware and is responsible for establishing connections between all software and related physical resources.**


**Tips: When Mr. Torvalds wrote the Linux kernel in 1991, in fact, the kernel could only "drive all 386 hardware". The so-called "let the 386 computer start running and wait for user command input". In fact, At that time, there were very few softwares that could run on Linux!**
